"""
CuTe DSL backend: Python programs that implement kernels with the NVIDIA CUTLASS CuTe DSL.

Similar structure to cuda_backend_utils: the evolved program is Python source defining
class ModelNew(nn.Module). Instead of compiling C++/CUDA via load_inline, it builds kernels
with `cutlass.cute` (the CuTe Python DSL) and JIT-compiles them with `cute.compile(...)`.

Kernels are written as Python functions decorated with `@cute.kernel` and launched from a
`@cute.jit` host function via `.launch(grid=..., block=...)`. Torch tensors are handed to the
DSL with `from cutlass.cute.runtime import from_dlpack`. The DSL targets the current torch CUDA
stream by default, so no explicit stream wiring is required.

ARCH_LIST (TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST) can be optionally provided in run_cfg, like cuda_inline.

Note: cute (like cuda_inline) uses a separate prompt directory. See
python_backend_utils.BACKENDS_WITH_SEPARATE_PROMPT_DIR and resources/prompts/backends/cute/.
